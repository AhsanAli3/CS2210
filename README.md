# CS2210 - Applied Data Structures & Algorithms

A collection of interactive games and applications built from the ground up using core data structures and algorithms. Each project demonstrates practical, real-world use cases — from pathfinding visualizers to game engines — showing how foundational CS concepts power the software we use every day.

## About

This repository serves as both a learning journal and a portfolio. Rather than solving textbook problems in isolation, every concept is applied to build something tangible:

- **Games** that rely on graph traversal, state machines, and efficient search
- **Tools & utilities** powered by trees, hash maps, and sorting algorithms
- **Visualizers** that bring abstract data structures to life

## Tech Stack

Projects are implemented in **Java**.

## Structure

Each project lives in its own directory with a dedicated README explaining the data structures and algorithms used, design decisions, and how to run it.

## Status

Actively in development — new projects are added as the course progresses.
